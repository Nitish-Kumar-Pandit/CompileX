# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Routing Issue on Render

## 🔍 Current Problem
- Page refresh shows "Not Found" error
- Direct URLs don't work
- This is a common React Router + static hosting issue

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Create _redirects file manually
1. Go to your **Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your frontend service (compilex-frontend)
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment**
4. Add this environment variable:
   - **Key**: `RENDER_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME`
   - **Value**: `your-domain.onrender.com`

### Step 2: Alternative - Use Render's Built-in SPA Support
1. In your Render service settings
2. Go to **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
3. Add this to **Build Command**:
   ```
   npm ci && npm run build && echo "/*    /index.html   200" > dist/_redirects
   ```

### Step 3: Manual File Upload (If needed)
If the above doesn't work, manually add this file to your repository:

**File**: `frontend/public/_redirects`
**Content**:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. **Trigger Manual Deploy** in Render Dashboard
2. Or **Push to GitHub** to trigger auto-deploy

## 🧪 Test After Deployment
1. ✅ Visit: `https://your-site.onrender.com/`
2. ✅ Visit: `https://your-site.onrender.com/about`
3. ✅ Visit: `https://your-site.onrender.com/editor/123`
4. ✅ **Refresh any page** - should work!

## 🔧 Alternative Solutions

### Option A: Use Hash Router (Quick Fix)
Change `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` in `App.jsx`:
```jsx
import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
// Replace BrowserRouter with HashRouter
```
URLs will look like: `yoursite.com/#/editor/123`

### Option B: Deploy to Netlify Instead
Netlify handles SPA routing automatically:
1. Connect GitHub to Netlify
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Deploy - routing will work automatically

## 📞 If Still Not Working
1. Check Render build logs for errors
2. Verify `_redirects` file exists in deployed files
3. Try the HashRouter solution as temporary fix
