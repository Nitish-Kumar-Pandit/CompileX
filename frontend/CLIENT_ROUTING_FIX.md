# 🔧 Client-Side Routing Fix for React Router

## 🚨 Problem
When deploying a React Router application to static hosting services like Render, Netlify, or Vercel, direct URLs (like `/editor/123`) or page refreshes result in a **404 Not Found** error.

## 🔍 Why This Happens
- React Router handles routing on the **client-side** (in the browser)
- When you visit `/editor/123` directly or refresh the page, the server looks for a file at that path
- Since it's a Single Page Application (SPA), only `/index.html` exists
- The server returns 404 because `/editor/123` doesn't exist as a file

## ✅ Solution
Configure the hosting service to redirect all routes to `/index.html` so React Router can handle the routing.

## 📁 Files Added

### 1. `public/_redirects` (for Render.com)
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 2. `netlify.toml` (for Netlify)
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 3. `render.yaml` (Updated)
```yaml
routes:
  - type: rewrite
    source: "/*"
    destination: "/index.html"
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### For Render.com:
1. The `_redirects` file in `public/` folder will be copied to `dist/` during build
2. Render will automatically use this file to handle routing
3. Redeploy your static site

### For Netlify:
1. The `netlify.toml` file handles routing configuration
2. Deploy normally - Netlify will automatically apply the redirects

### For Vercel:
Create `vercel.json` in the root:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Testing
After deployment:
1. ✅ Visit your site normally: `https://yoursite.com`
2. ✅ Visit a direct route: `https://yoursite.com/editor/123`
3. ✅ Refresh any page - should work without 404

## 📝 Notes
- The `200` status code is important - it tells the browser the page loaded successfully
- This fix works for all React Router routes: `/`, `/about`, `/editor/:id`, etc.
- The original URL is preserved in the browser address bar
