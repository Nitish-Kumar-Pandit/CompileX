# 🚀 Quick HashRouter Fix (Alternative Solution)

If the _redirects solution doesn't work immediately, you can use this quick fix:

## 📝 Change BrowserRouter to HashRouter

**File**: `frontend/src/App.jsx`

**Find this line**:
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Navigate, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**Replace with**:
```jsx
import { HashRouter, Navigate, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
```

**Find this line**:
```jsx
<BrowserRouter>
```

**Replace with**:
```jsx
<HashRouter>
```

**Find this line**:
```jsx
</BrowserRouter>
```

**Replace with**:
```jsx
</HashRouter>
```

## 🎯 Result
- URLs will look like: `yoursite.com/#/editor/123`
- Page refresh will work perfectly
- No server configuration needed
- Works on any static hosting

## 🔄 To Apply
1. Make the changes above
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Render will auto-deploy
4. Test - routing should work immediately!

## ⚠️ Trade-off
- URLs have `#` in them (e.g., `site.com/#/about`)
- SEO is slightly less optimal
- But it works 100% reliably on static hosting

This is a proven solution that works immediately while we fix the _redirects approach!
